# Group Alpha
A website that sells a variety of boxes!

- Navbar and footer are in the frames folder. Both are implemented using <iframe> tag. In order to change a link, go to the frames folder and edit links there. This makes it easier to manage the website (ie, not having to go to each webpage to edit links).

## NOTES

- I will work on store.html (located in products directory)
- Link to view the website has changed to https://mark-jovero.github.io/GroupAlpha/
  
## TODO [due March 19]
- finish websites/links
- Product art
