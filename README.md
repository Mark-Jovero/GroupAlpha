# Group Alpha
AUTHORS: JESSICA ZEPEDA, MARK JOVERO, MEDHAT ELKHIESH (**?**)

A website that sells office supplies!

## NOTES
- Link to view the website has changed to **https://mark-jovero.github.io/GroupAlpha/**
- Navbar and footer are in the frames folder. Both are implemented using <iframe> tag. In order to change a link, go to the frames folder and edit links there. This makes it easier to manage the website (ie, not having to go to each webpage to edit links).
## TODO [due n/a]
  - ~~finish websites/links~~
  - ~~Product art~~
  - Replace product art with something more "modern"
  - Replace iFrames with javascript, once prof. Bierman allows use of js
  - *Add product page for each product* (and remove some (or all) of the boxes)
  - Work on logo
  - Create social media accounts?
